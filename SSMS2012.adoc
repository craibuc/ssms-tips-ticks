== Snippets

Snippets are a fast way to insert large blocks of code with simple keystrokes.

General requirements:

 - Application-defined snippets are located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\110\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\SQL\Snippets\1033` or one of its children.  Non-standard subfolders (i.e. those made by the user) are ignored.
 - User-defined snippets may be added to `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\SQL Server Management Studio\Code Snippets\SQL\My Code Snippets`.  A remote folder may be used instead by creating a symlink: `C:\Users\<user>\Documents\SQL Server Management Studio\Code Snippets\SQL> mklink /d "My Code Snippets" "\\server\path\to\folder"`.
 - File must use a valid XML document that complies with its schema (when in doubt, use an existing snippet as a template).
 - File must end with `.snippet`.

=== Code Snippets Manager

Snippets can be managed by using the Code Snippets Manager.

Open the Code Snippets Manager by choosing `Tools | Code Snippets Manager...` or by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+K], kbd:[Ctrl+X]:
